# Architecture

FastAPI app (app/main.py) with routers per area. Current routers: auth.

Layers: routers (HTTP) -> services (business logic) -> models (SQLAlchemy).
Shared code in app/core: config, database, security (hashing, tokens), deps (current user, role guard).
Auth flow: POST /auth/login sets an HttpOnly cookie; get_current_user reads it on each request.
